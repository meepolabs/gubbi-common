"""Ban accidental ``JOURNAL_JOURNAL_`` doubled-prefix env-var names.

Catches the failure mode where a pydantic Settings field whose Python name
starts with ``journal_`` is declared under
``model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix="JOURNAL_", ...)`` and silently
produces an env var named ``JOURNAL_JOURNAL_<NAME>``.  The fix is to set
``validation_alias=`` on the field to declare its env name explicitly.

Allowlist: ``JOURNAL_JOURNAL_TARGET_URL`` is documented as a known exception
(rename deferred until it can ride a deploy).

Exit 0 on success, 1 on any non-allowlisted match.
